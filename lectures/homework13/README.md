## Overview
<hr />

This notebook contains exercise 13 (Optional exercise 3). This exercise was proposed by Professor Valdivino Santiago JÃºnior in the course CAP421 - Deep Learning offered in the Postgraduate Program in Applied Computing at the National Institute for Space Research.

**RNNs Exercise 1:**
> Consider this target dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/
valdivinosantiago/amazonia1-cbers4a-simple. Using any GAN, generate fake images based on this dataset. You may crop the images of the target dataset, if you want. Work with three bands only: RGB. Compose the bands of both datasets: target and fake. Show, via some metric, that your fake images dataset is really close to the target one.
